I believe my preference for the final project design would be the style like 1 for several reasons. Well first, the color pallet seems to fit my personal style better, as well as the textures. Also, as being a personal website, the first style I could add a lot more information as text and bullet points that I could in the second style. Being a beginner in photoshop, I could not add much characteristics to both of the styles, but I personally think that style 1 would better fit my desire for a personal website.
