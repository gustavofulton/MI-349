Main page
  Welcome to my Personal Website! Here you will find all information about me: what I love, hate and am passionate about. Hope you enjoy it.

About
  I am a Junior Computer Science student at Michigan State University with a minor in Game Design. I am really passionate with front-end and back-end development, but my hobbies are pretty eclectic! Besides the times I'm siting on the computer coding or playing games, I am either playing music or reading some really interesting book! Also, nature is my best friend.

Portfolio
  Although this section is still almost empty, it's in development and soon I hope to post more cool stuff in here! Here you can find some hackathon projects, personal projects as well as small games I made.

Contact
  Here is my personal contact if you wanna get in touch with me. If you have any suggestions, critiques or just wanna chat, you can add me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/gustavo-fulton-9717a2b6
